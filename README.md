# Update All Tokens
Gives the owner of an actor the ability to update all tokens in the game to match the prototype token. A new button will appear when you are updating a prototype token. Clicking on Update All will pop up a new window where you can select which properties of the prototype token you would like to apply to all tokens of that actor in the world.

## Installation
In the Foundry VTT module manager, click the Install Module button and paste this URL into the Manifest URL box, then click Install: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kree-nickm/fvtt-update-all-tokens/main/module.json`

## Compatibility
This shouldn't conflict with any other modules. If Foundry ever changes how token data is stored or configured, that would likely break this module.

As usual with my modules, if this module breaks due to a Foundry update, I will not fix it until I update to the latest version of Foundry in my own games, which I will not do until most of the other modules I use have been confirmed to work on the new version of Foundry.
